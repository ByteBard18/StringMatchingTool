# String Matching Tool

## Project Overview

The **String Matching Tool** is a web application designed to allow users to search across multiple `.txt` documents simultaneously. The tool utilizes two powerful algorithms:

- **BM25 Algorithm**: Used for document relevancy ranking based on the search query.
- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: Efficient for fast string searching to detect lines containing the queried term.

The application is built using a **React frontend** and a **Django backend**, effectively leveraging modern data structures such as **Stacks** to detect and store relevant lines in documents.

## Features

- Simultaneous search across multiple `.txt` documents.
- **BM25 Algorithm** for document relevancy ranking.
- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm** for efficient string searching.
- Data structures like **Stacks** used for results formatting and optimization.
- Easy-to-use web interface for uploading documents and querying search terms.
- Search terms can include **phrases** as well.

> **Note**:
> - Currently, only up to **5 files** can be uploaded at a time, and all files must be in `.txt` format.
> - All uploaded files are stored in the `media/` folder of the Django server.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Search Algorithms**: BM25 (document relevancy), Boyer-Moore (string searching)
- **Data Structures**: Stacks
- **File Handling**: Support for `.txt` files only (up to 5 files at once)

## System Architecture

1. **Frontend (React)**: Users can upload `.txt` files and input search queries.
2. **Backend (Django)**: Manages the search operations using the BM25 and Boyer-Moore algorithms, and returns the lines of text where the search term appears.

## Key Algorithms

### BM25 (Best Matching 25)

The BM25 algorithm is used to evaluate the relevance of a document to a given query by:

-   Calculating term frequency and inverse document frequency.
-   Ranking documents based on their relevance scores.

Here is the Algorithm Library referred to while developing this project:   [BM25 ALGORITHM](https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25)

### Boyer-Moore Algorithm

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a string searching technique that skips sections of the text where the search term cannot possibly match. Its efficiency makes it suitable for large documents.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x and pip
- Django
- Virtualenv (recommended for Django)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/string-matching-tool.git
cd string-matching-tool
```

### 2. Frontend Setup (REACT-VITE)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
### 3. Backend Setup (DJANGO)

```bash
cd ../backend
python3 -m venv venv         # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate      # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all the dependencies

```
Make sure to create a `.env` file for environment variables if needed.

### 4. Creating Superuser for Admin Access

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
You will be prompted to enter a username, email, and password for the admin account.
Once the superuser is created, you can access the Django admin panel by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

### 5. Running the application
#### Run the Django Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Apply migrations and start the Django development server.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
By default, this will start the backend on `http://localhost:8000/`.

#### Run the React Frontend

In another terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the React app:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:5173/`.

### 6. Testing the Application

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/` to interact with the frontend. You can now upload `.txt` files (up to 5 at a time) and start querying search terms, including phrases. The React frontend communicates with the Django backend to process the search.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Handling Larger Datasets**: Scaling with more efficient indexing and storage mechanisms such as Elasticsearch for faster retrieval.
-   **Support for More File Types**: Adding support for PDFs and Word documents.
-   **Improved UX**: Incorporating advanced filtering options and fuzzy search capabilities for better user experience.
-   **Machine Learning Integration**: Using NLP models for better relevancy ranking beyond BM25.
